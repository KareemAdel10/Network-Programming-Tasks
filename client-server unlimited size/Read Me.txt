The code is designed to handle messages of any size.

In the server-side code, it first receives the length of the message using recv(HEADER_LENGTH), where HEADER_LENGTH is set to 4 bytes, assuming that the length of the message will be sent as a 4-byte integer. This allows the server to know how much data to expect.

Then, it enters a loop to receive the message data in chunks until it has received the entire message. The loop continues until the total received bytes equal the expected message length.

Similarly, in the client-side code, it sends the message length followed by the message data. This ensures that the server knows how much data to expect.
